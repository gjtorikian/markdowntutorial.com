Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It's written in what nerds like to
call "plaintext," which is exactly the sort of text you're used to writing and seeing. Plaintext
is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( <code>*</code>) and
backticks ( <code>`</code>).

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in
Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It's
quickly becoming the writing standard for [academics][academics],
[scientists][scientists], [writers][writers], and many more.
Websites like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and [reddit](http://www.reddit.com)
use Markdown to style their comments.

Markdown is a format that requires a very gentle learning curve. It doesn't control
the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text—stuff
like making things bold, creating headers, and organizing lists.

If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown!

In each lesson, you'll be given an introduction to a single Markdown concept, and you'll
be asked to complete several exercises with that new knowledge.
